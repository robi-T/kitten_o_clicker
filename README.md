## About the app

The KittenO'Clicker app is an Udacity FE Developer Nanodegree excercise in which the MVC concept is implemented using vanilla JS.
The app basically counts number of clicks on images of kittens and allows the user to update the data. I took time to work on that assignement to get myself aquentant with the MVC core concept before diving into the existing frameworks.

## Running the app

Since all the code is written in the client-side JS, it is enough to download or clone the project and open index.html in any browser.
